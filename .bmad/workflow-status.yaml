# Decision Log (Quick References)
decisions:
  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for multi-tenant isolation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/001-rls-multi-tenancy.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Database-level security, zero-trust architecture

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "JWT with refresh token rotation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/002-jwt-refresh-rotation.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Security best practice, 15min access + 7-day refresh

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Module-based backend architecture"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/003-module-architecture.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Separation of concerns, testability, scalability

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Fastify over Express"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/004-fastify-framework.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Performance (2x faster), built-in validation, TypeScript support

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Zod for environment validation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/005-zod-env-validation.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Fail-fast on misconfiguration, type-safe env access

  - date: 2026-01-15
    title: "AI document generation IS MVP core (not post-MVP)"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/006-ai-mvp-core.md
    impact: critical
    rationale: Beta testers cannot evaluate "60-70% time savings" without AI doing the documentation. Swedish-specific templates (månadsrapporter, handledarrapporter, journalanteckningar) + email/calendar AI required for MVP.
