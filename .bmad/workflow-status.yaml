# Notes and Context
notes: |
  **Current Status (2026-01-15):**
  - 70% complete toward beta-ready MVP
  - Core features implemented and functional
  - Test suite has failures - SCAR working on fix (Issue #135)
  - Planning workspace activated today (BMAD methodology)

  **Immediate Priorities:**
  1. Fix test failures (Issue #135 - in progress)
  2. GDPR compliance features (data export/deletion)
  3. Production deployment documentation
  4. Beta tester recruitment

  **Blockers:**
  - Test failures preventing deployment confidence
  - GDPR features required before EU/Swedish launch

  **Recent Achievements:**
  - Google OAuth authentication (Issue #120)
  - Client information fields (Issue #125)
  - Social worker associations (Issue #126)
  - File upload system (Issue #127)
  - AI document processing UX (Issue #133)

  **Technical Debt:**
  - ADRs not documented (need to record architectural decisions)
  - Test coverage unknown (need full coverage analysis)
  - Performance not benchmarked (RLS overhead, caching needs)
  - Deployment guide missing

# Decision Log (Quick References)
decisions:
  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for multi-tenant isolation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/001-rls-multi-tenancy.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Database-level security, zero-trust architecture

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "JWT with refresh token rotation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/002-jwt-refresh-rotation.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Security best practice, 15min access + 7-day refresh

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Module-based backend architecture"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/003-module-architecture.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Separation of concerns, testability, scalability

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Fastify over Express"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/004-fastify-framework.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Performance (2x faster), built-in validation, TypeScript support

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Zod for environment validation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/005-zod-env-validation.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Fail-fast on misconfiguration, type-safe env access

  - date: 2026-01-15
    title: "Defer AI features to post-MVP"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/006-defer-ai-features.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Focus on core workflows, validate product-market fit first
